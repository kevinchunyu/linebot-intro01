# KEVIN's SIMPLE LINE BOT

## Introduction
***
Hello! My name is Kevin Ko, currently a Junior at the University of Washington-Seattle, studying both GIS:Data Science and Informatics. Specifically, GIS: Data Science explores data management, data visualiation, and societal implications of data science in a geographical setting. Informatics, on the other hand, explores the interaction between technology and human. Using that interaction to serve as a bridge to motivate and encourage innovation, creativity, and design of technology.
